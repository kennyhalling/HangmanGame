# Overview


I wrote a program that will play a game of hangman with the user. The program randomly chooses a word from a database, opens a terminal, and displays both blank spaces equal to the number of letters in the random word and a gallows made with ASCII
art. As the user guesses letters, the spaces either fill in on correct answers or a stick man is built on the gallows. After 6 wrong guesses, the man is complete and the users loses.

I wrote this software to learn about the C++ language. This was my first exposure to it, and wanted to have simple program to start with.

# Development Environment

For this software, I used Visual Studio 2022 as a development environment on a Windows 11 laptop. I used Google Chrome for any research that I needed to do.

The software itself was written in the C++ language. I used 7 libraries that were built into C++, but no third-party libraries.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I want to incorporate into the display a letter bank showing previously guessed incorrect letters.
- I want to make a GUI to make the game look nicer and easier to use for users.
- I want to make the word database bigger, potentially by including an AI
